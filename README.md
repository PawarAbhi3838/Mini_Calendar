# Mini_Calendar
In this Project we will make a mini calendar with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This calendar will display the today's date, day, month, and year.
This date will be updated every day.
In this project we will use the "Date Object" of javascript to get the today's date and display on your website.
