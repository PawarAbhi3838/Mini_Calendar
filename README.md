# Mini_Calendar
In this Project we will make a mini calendar with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
This calendar will display the today's date, day, month, and year.<br>
This date will be updated every day.<br>
In this project we will use the "Date Object" of javascript to get the today's date and display on your website.
